Genetic programming is an algorithm that employs chromosomes and genes to represent individuals. Its aim is to generate a population containing an individual who accomplishes a specific objective through fitness. The fitness function serves as a metric to determine whether the individuals produced in the process have met the objective, and it is the function that we aim to maximize or minimize depending on the problem at hand.

In this work, we demonstrate how to solve genetic algorithm problems from the ground up using only numpy. These tasks are significant as they emphasize the importance of comprehending the underlying principles before utilizing more intricate libraries.

Within this repository, we provide genetic algorithms as vectors and tree-like programs for evolutionary algorithms. The former tackles optimization problems, whereas the latter addresses regression problems.
